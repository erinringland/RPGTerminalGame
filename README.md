# RPGTerminalGame

A work in progress!

## The story

You play as knight tasked to fight various monsters to reach the treasure chest for your kingdom. Along the way the monsters drop potions to heal yourself and stronger weapons to help you in your quest. 

## Erin's notes

This project is a extension of a class project, a RPG fighting monsters in the terminal. This project was created with the purspose for me to practice C#, OOP practices, and interacting with a database. The programs I used include Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
